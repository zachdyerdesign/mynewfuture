								<h3>10 Common Issues</h3>
							</header>-->
							<p>Coaching with Wade can be done person-to-person, via Skype, or by phone. Here are 10 common issues that others have successfully worked through.</p>
							<ol class="default">
								<li>I want to hear from God for myself, and I have been in this place for years.</li>
								<li>I have dreams that I don't understand, and I want to interpret them.</li>
 								<li>I want a better job with more money, and I think something is missing.</li>
								<li>I attended a conference but I don't know how to apply what was taught.</li>
								<li>I want to grow and but I don't know where to start.</li>
								<li>I hear great sermons at church, but I soon forget them.</li>
								<li>I have some habits to overcome that I believe retard my spiritual growth.</li>
								<li>I sense that I am being controlled by my pastor and church leaders.</li>
								<li>I want some help in cleaning up my life and renewing my mind.</li>
								<li>I want to examine and develop new relational skills.</li>
							</ol>

								<h3>Following the Jesus Method</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Jesus was a Hebrew. He employed a Hebrew (lamad) style of training, easily compared to coaching. The Hebrew language uses one root word (lamad) for the English words "to teach" and "to learn." So, only when the student is actually doing what the teacher taught, the teacher has succeeded.</p>
							<p>Here teacher and follower connect information with implementation. Both are aware of the danger of "over-informing"—that information without implementation will not bring change. Jesus modeled this (lamad) approach with the expectation that we would follow it. It’s foundational to developing growth-centered relationships.</p>
