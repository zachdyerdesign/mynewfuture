											<h3>Underlayments</h3>
										</header>
										<p>If you install carpeting without a pad, it will not be as comfortable to walk on and it will wear out faster. If you install tile on a cracked concrete subfloor it will enventually crack the tile and grout. If you install a wood, cork, or bamboo floating floor on an unlevel subfloor, the edges will not fit well together. Consequently you will stub your toes and eventually destroy that part of the floor.</p>

											<h3>Heated Floors</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Cold mornings can be a challenge — the alarm clock rings, signaling that it's time to get out of your warm, cocoon-like bed, but you dread having to step foot onto the cold tile floor as you make your way to the shower. If your bathroom floor were warm and toasty, wouldn't mornings be just a little easier to embrace? </p>
